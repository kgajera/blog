# About Me — Kishan Gajera

My name’s Kishan Gajera. I’m a software engineer based in the Washington D.C. area. I have 10+ years of professional experience and counting. In my spare time, I work as a freelancer building websites for causes I care about.

I’m a programmer through and through. I find simple solutions to complex problems. I work incredibly hard to stay ahead of new technology and web standards. I work smart to deliver high quality results that my clients and I will be proud of.

In the few hours when I’m not programming, you’ll find me at the gym.

Have questions or interested in working with me? Feel free to [contact me](/contact).
